### Alternate & Twice Function

#### Points: 8.00

<hr>

#### Description:

Create the functions `alternate` and `twice`.

- The `alternate` function returns function that returns a value every other time it is called.

- The `twice` function can only invoke the function passed to it a total of two times. (...this should sound a lot like the `once` function but with a twist!)
