### Reduce Right

#### Points: 3.00

<hr>

### Description:

Create a function called `reduceRight` that accepts an array, a starting value and an iterating function. **Instead of iterating over the array from left to right, the `reduceRight` function iterates from right to left**. (it starts from the last index in the array and stops at the zeroth index in the array argument)
