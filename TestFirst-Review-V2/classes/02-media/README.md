### Media / Library

This is a classic example of class design in computer science. If you are a computer science major you have probably seen this exact problem or another variation of it.

Create a base class, `Media` which has multiple subclasses (extensions) such as:

- Album
- Movie
- Book

All of the sublcasses should have the same instance properties as a Media instance in addition to their unique properties.

The test specs are self-explanatory and you should be able to get a good grasp of the problem just by reading the specs. The description for this exercise is intentionally short...read the specs!
