Review class syntax and refactor your RPN Calculator solution that uses a constructor function and refactor your solution to use class syntax.

#### 01 - Classes

The `class` exercises in TestFirst will challenge you in creating a Parent/Child relationship using `class` and subclass (`extends`) syntax using ES2015 syntax. In the exercises you will need to use:

- `class`
- `class Subclass extends ParentClass`
- add a `constructor` method to a class
- use the `super()` function in a `constructor` method of a Subclass

#### 02 - Macbook

This is another `class` based exercise, make sure to read the README.md for the problem.





**Note:** It is important to have an understanding of the prototype chain before completing these exercises.
