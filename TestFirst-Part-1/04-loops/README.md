### Overview

Looping is a powerful part of any programming language and allows you to repeat a task until a conditional expression evaluates to false. Normally a loop has:

- Initial Value (Starting Point)
- Loop Body (The code that runs each pass of the loop)
- Conditional Expression (Evaluated each pass of the loop, when it evaluates to false the loop is exited)
- Counter (the variable that changes each pass of the loop)

A loop is a great way to run a block of code over and over until a condition is met. The Loops TestSpec will also introduce you to looping over an object's keys and values using a `for in` loop. Remember, it's not good practice to use a `for in` loop to traverse arrays!

The goal of this TestSpec is to become familiar and comfortable with looping, using nested loops, and looping over an object.
